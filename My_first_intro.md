## Hey there!

Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eva Pataki.

I'm working on brushing up my computer skills. It's pretty cool to see how much tech has evolved, especially how students can team up and create projects together. Their creativity is seriously impressive!

One thing that really blows my mind is the whole virtual desktop thingâ€”being able to work from anywhere and collaborate seamlessly is something I never imagined back in the day.

## A Throwback Moment
Just for fun, here's a pic of a classic late '90s computerâ€”similar to what I used as a student:

Back then, artificial intelligence was just something out of sci-fi movies. It wasn't exactly portrayed in the best lightâ€”just look at HAL 9000 from *2001: A Space Odyssey*! Definitely not the best advertisement for AI. 

## HAL 9000 in Action
Here's a clip featuring HAL:
